# Hi there 

I'm a Junior Data Scientist and MSc student in Data Science & Computing Systems (University of Granada): I´m passionate about applying data-driven approachs to solve real-world problems, especially in biomedicine, genomics, and renewable energy.  
I am currently expanding my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data science, with the goal of contributing to projects that advance healthcare, scientific research, and sustainability.


##  About Me
-  Enthusiastic about data exploration, visualization, and uncovering actionable insights from complex datasets.
-  I´ve always felt a strong need to develop my full potential, and I´ve found that data science is the most powerful way to do so - by connecting analytical thinking with real-world impact.
-  Particularly interested in biomedical data analysis, including genomics and transcriptomics (RNA-Seq), as well as apllications in renewable energy.
-  Currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science & Comupting Systems (University of Granada, UGR) and collaborating on academic research projects in biomedicine.
-  Focused on building a strong foundation to transition into Data Science roles in the near future.
-  Motivated by projects that have a tangible, positive impact on society.


##  Currently Learning
- Bioinformatics and RNA-Seq data Analysis and Visualization using real-woorld biomedical datasets (e.q T.C.G.A).
- Machine Learning and Predictive Modeling applied to health and genomics.
- Advanced Statistics and Mathematics Foundations for Data Science.


##  Goals
- Contribute to interdisciplinary projects that use data to solve real-world challenges in healthcare, genomics and sustainability.  
- Continue growing both technically and professionally in the fields of health, genomics, and sustainability.
- Build a career based on continuous learning, scientific rigor, and real-world impact.
